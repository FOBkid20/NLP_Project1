## Description
This program generates a list of presenters, hosts, nominees, awards, and winners from a dataset of tweets about the golden globes from a given year.

The program outputs this information in two ways: a human-readable format and a json. The json does not use our self-generated awards, but the given awards. The awards we generated can be seen in the human-readable output.

## Usage
run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To see human readable format, run `python gg_api.py`
